## 10/26/2025 - Created Frame  

I created the basic frame for my printer which took forever!!

Basically, I decided to use fusion 360 for my project, because it had a lot of tools I could use for my project. Only problem was that I didn't know how to use fusion.
It took me a bunch of time but eventually I learnt the basic things and made this frame.

The idea for my printer is to make a printer that is faster than a modern printer like the X1C, which costs $2000.

Heres what the current frame looks like:
